        <p class="lead">ReactJS, also known as React, is a well-known open-source JavaScript front-end library for creating dynamic and interactive applications and improving UI/UX design. Basically, it’s responsible only for the view layer. Facebook initially developed and maintained the technology, which was then used in some of its products, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. With frameworks such as Next.js, React can be utilized for developing single-page, mobile, or server-side applications. It allows code to be debugged more efficiently by separating it into components.
        <br>More than 220,000 websites currently utilize React. A few of the giants that use this platform for their applications/websites include Apple, PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix
        <h4 style="padding-left: 50px;">Key Features:</h4>
        <ul class="lead" style="padding-left: 50px;"><li>The application built with ReactJS has a component-based architecture, meaning that it consists of several components, each with its own logic written in JS. The reusable nature of these components allows you to maintain the code when working on larger-scale projects.</li>

        <li>The Virtual DOM of React offers flexibility and speeds up app development. Document object models (DOMs) are APIs (Application programming interfaces) that manage how documents can be accessed and manipulated.</li>
        <li>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a markup syntax for describing the interface of an application.  With JSX, you can write and add HTML structures easily in React.</li>
        <li>With declarative UI, React code can be more easily read and fixed. In terms of developing UIs that are exciting and engaging, React JS is the best choice not just for web applications but also for mobile applications.</li></ul>

        <p class="lead">AngularJS is an open-source Javascript front-end framework and is an integral part of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, And Node.js). It is mostly used for developing single-page web applications (SPAs). Since it’s a flexible framework, developers can create progressive web apps or integrate the framework with technologies such as Ionic, Cordova, or NativeScripy to design near-native mobile applications.
          <br>The tool has inbuilt templates that make it easy for developers to build UI views quickly. AngularJS provides simple, fast data binding without developer intervention. By supporting caching, it reduces the CPU’s workload. It provides fast loading and less navigation, ensuring an effective user experience. Gmail, Forbes, Upwork,  Deutsche Bank, etc., are some of the popular websites and applications built using Angular.js.
          <h4 style="padding-left: 50px;">Key Features:</h4>
          <ul class="lead" style="padding-left: 50px;"><li>With an Angular application, data binding is performed without the need to write any separate code. By adding a few snippets of code, we are able to connect data from the HTML control to the application data.</li>
          <li>An Angular application is not browser-specific, so there are no browser-specific constraints. Besides internet explorer 8.0, it runs on all major browsers and on mobile devices, including Android and iOS-based devices.</li>
          <li>A built-in dependency injection feature in AngularJS makes it easy to develop, test, and understand applications.</li>
          <li>A number of built-in services are available with AngularJS, such as $http to make XMLHttpRequests. They are singleton objects that are instantiated only once in the app.</li>
          <li>Furthermore, Angular’s templates make it possible to create a user interface views rapidly, which aids software development teams to become more productive.</li></ul>

        <p class="lead">The popular Javascript framework ‘Vue.js’ was created by Evan You and used to develop interactive UIs (User Interfaces) (UIs) and SPAs (Single-page applications). Vue.js is one of the best JavaScript frameworks for creating a lightweight and adaptable interactive UI elements. The MVVM model (Model View-View Model) architecture pattern and its lightweight nature make Vue.js extremely easy to implement.
          <br>HTML and CSS knowledge is required to use Vue.js. Also, Vue.js has a core library focused solely on the view layer. Frameworks like this can be seamlessly integrated into big projects for front-end development without causing any problems or issues. 9GAG, GitLab, Nintendo, Behance, and Laravel are some of the popular websites and applications built using Vue.js.
          <ul class="lead" style="padding-left: 50px;"><li>VueJS provides computed properties, which enable you to detect changes made to UI elements and perform calculations accordingly. You do not have to add any additional code to do this.</li>
            <li>VueJS comes with several built-in directives for performing various tasks on the frontend, such as v-show, v-if, v-else, v-bind, v-model, and v-on.</li>
            <li>Watchers in Vue.js allow you to watch or monitor a component and perform specified actions when its values change. This is a more general way to watch and respond to data changes in a Vue instance. It is particularly useful when performing asynchronous operations.</li>
            <li>VueJS components allow you to create custom elements that you can reuse in HTML.</li>
            <li>Various transitions can be applied to HTML elements when they are added/updated/removed from the DOM (Document Object Model).</li></ul>
